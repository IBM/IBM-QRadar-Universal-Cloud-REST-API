## QRadar Log Source Configuration

Cyble Threat Intel Workflow utilizes QRadar's Universal REST API Protocol to fetch data from Cyble Vision.
Cyble has a dedicated DSM to parse the incoming events properly.

The steps to configure a log source on the QRadarÂ® Console using the Workflow field so that the defined endpoint can communicate with QRadar by using the Universal Rest API protocol are as follows:

1. Log in to QRadar.
2. Admin Panel > click on the 'QRadar Log Source Management' or 'Log Sources' app icon. 
3. Click 'Log Sources' > 'New Log Source' > 'Single Log Source'. 
4. On the 'Select Log Source Type' page, select __Cyble Threat Intel DSM__ from the list:
    - If 'Cyble Threat Intel DSM' does not appear in the list, follow the steps to install the DSM as given below.
    - Note that you can also use your own mapping and use 'Universal DSM' - we recommend to use 'Cyble Threat Intel DSM'.
5. On the 'Select Protocol Type' page, select __Universal Cloud REST API__, and proceed to next step. 
6. On the 'Configure the Log Source parameters' page, configure the log source parameters:
    - __Name__: __Cyble Threat Intel__
    - __Enabled__: __On__
    - __Coalescing Events__: __Off__
    - Keep rest of the settings as default, and proceed to next step.
7. On the Configure the Protocol Parameters page:
    - __Log source identifier__: < same as __hostname__ above >
    - Copy the workflow code from __Cyble-Threat-Intel-Workflow.xml__ and paste it into the 'Workflow' field
    - Copy the workflow params from __Cyble-Threat-Intel-Workflow-Parameter-Values.xml__, populate the fields and paste into the 'Workflow Parameters Values' field
    - __Untrusted Certificates__: __Allow__
    - Set Recurrence as per your choice. Recommended value is 30M.
    - Keep rest of the settings as default, and proceed to next step.
8. In the Test protocol parameters window, click 'Start Test'. All tests should pass.
9. To fix any errors, click 'Configure Protocol Parameters'. Configure the parameters and click Test Protocol Parameters. 
10. Click 'Finish'
11. Navigate to the 'Admin' tab. From the top bar choose 'Deploy Changes'
